# **Sander Nathaniel Karlsen LÃ¥stad**
As a developer with a passion for creating software for the public since 2019, I embarked on an exciting journey that led to the release of the Discord bot 'UltimateRPG' in 2020. Over the years, UltimateRPG has grown into a beloved and sustainable product, cherished by many users.

Developing UltimateRPG posed several significant challenges, including Database Management, Cloud Hosting Solutions, and the continuous improvement of the code. Despite having only just dipped my feet into coding, the project has been a tremendous motivator and a substantial challenge. The process has been a rewarding experience, driving me to push the boundaries of my skills and knowledge.

Now I seek new challenges, and have learned to develop websites using Next.JS-React, Node.JS Servers and learned tons of new languages such as Typescript, Javascript, C#, Java and Swift.
