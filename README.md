# **Sander Nathaniel Karlsen LÃ¥stad**
As a developer with a passion for creating software for the public since 2019, I embarked on an exciting journey that led to the release of the Discord bot 'UltimateRPG' in 2020. Over the years, UltimateRPG has grown into a beloved and sustainable product, cherished by many users.

Developing UltimateRPG posed several significant challenges, including Database Management, Cloud Hosting Solutions, and the continuous improvement of the code. Despite having only just dipped my feet into coding, the project has been a tremendous motivator and a substantial challenge. The process has been a rewarding experience, driving me to push the boundaries of my skills and knowledge.

Now I seek new challenges, and have learned to develop websites using Next.JS-React, Node.JS Servers and learned tons of new languages such as Typescript, Javascript, C#, Java and Swift.

# My Projects
## UltimateRPG
UltimateRPG is a text-based RPG game that may be invited to Discord servers to engage your users.
It was developed in 2019, but wasn't fully developed before 2020. The bot has been added to more than 17 thousand servers, and has generated
enough revenue to buy me my very first car.

# Nordev AS
As of September 2024, me and some very good friends of mine founded a company called Nordev AS.
The goal? To develop applications used world wide.

I cannot reveal too much at this time, but time will tell what we have in store for the world.
